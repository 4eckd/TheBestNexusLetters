- **Supported Failure Types:**
  - 🔐 **Dependency Vulnerabilities** (Auto-fixable)
  - 🧹 **Lint Errors** (Auto-fixable)
  - 📦 **Dependency Issues** (Auto-fixable)
  - 🚀 **Deployment Errors** (Auto-fixable)
  - ⏱️ **Timeout Errors** (Auto-fixable)
  - 🔴 **Type Errors** (Manual review required)
  - 🧪 **Test Failures** (Manual review required)
  - 🏗️ **Build Errors** (Manual review required)

### 3. **Intelligent Remediation Engine**

- **File:** `scripts/failure-remediation.js`
- **Capabilities:**
  - Pattern matching with confidence scoring
  - Historical failure tracking and learning
  - Success rate analytics
  - Automated fix application
  - Comprehensive reporting

### 4. **GitHub Actions Integration**

- **Primary Workflows:**
  - `ci.yml` - Basic CI/CD pipeline
  - `ci-enhanced.yml` - Quality gates with coverage enforcement
  - `cd.yml` - Deployment pipeline
  - `auto-remediate-failures.yml` - Failure remediation system
  - `test-remediation.yml` - Manual testing of remediation system

## 🔧 Automatic Remediation Actions

| Failure Type                   | Automatic Actions                          | Success Rate |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| **Dependency Vulnerabilities** | `pnpm audit fix`, lockfile updates         | High         |
| **Lint Errors**                | `eslint --fix`, `prettier --write`         | High         |
| **Cache Issues**               | Clear pnpm/Next.js/node_modules cache      | High         |
| **Dependency Conflicts**       | Clean install, lockfile regeneration       | Medium       |
| **Deployment Failures**        | Environment validation, retry with backoff | Medium       |

## 📊 Monitoring & Alerting

### GitHub Issue Management

- **Auto-created issues** for failure patterns
- **Categorized by failure type** with proper labels
- **Automatic updates** when new instances occur
- **Auto-closing** when workflows succeed again

### Labels Applied

- `auto-failure` - All automated failure issues
- `failure-type:{type}` - Specific failure classification
- `auto-fixable` / `manual-fix-required` - Remediation capability
- `priority:high` - Critical issues requiring attention

## 🎯 Key Features

### 🔄 **Intelligent Retry Logic**

- Different retry strategies per failure type
- Exponential backoff for transient issues
- Maximum attempt limits to prevent infinite loops

### 📈 **Historical Learning**

- Tracks failure patterns over time
- Learns from successful remediation attempts
- Builds confidence scoring for pattern matching

### 🛡️ **Safe Automation**

- Only applies fixes for well-understood, safe failure types
- Preserves audit trails of all automated changes
- Rollback capabilities via git stash integration

### 📱 **Comprehensive Reporting**

- Detailed failure analysis reports
- Remediation action summaries
- Success/failure metrics tracking
- GitHub Action summary outputs

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Manual Remediation Testing

```bash
# Test remediation system manually
npm run remediate:test

# Analyze specific failure pattern
npm run remediate:analyze -- --pattern="lint_error"

# Generate remediation report
npm run remediate:report
```

### Workflow Debugging
