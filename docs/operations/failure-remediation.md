# Automated Failure Remediation System

The Best Nexus Letters project includes a comprehensive automated failure remediation system that detects, analyzes, and attempts to fix common CI/CD failures automatically.

## Overview

The system consists of several components:

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/auto-remediate-failures.yml`) - Main orchestrator
2. **Configuration File** (`.github/failure-remediation-config.yml`) - Pattern definitions and settings
3. **Node.js Script** (`scripts/failure-remediation.js`) - Core analysis and remediation logic
4. **Failure History** (`.github/failure-history.json`) - Historical data and success rates

## Features

### Automatic Detection
- Monitors all CI/CD workflows for failures
- Runs every 15 minutes via scheduled job
- Triggered immediately when workflows fail
- Analyzes failure patterns with confidence scoring

### Intelligent Analysis
- Pattern matching against common failure types
- Contextual analysis of logs and error messages
- Historical failure tracking and success rate calculation
- Confidence scoring for accurate classification

### Auto-Remediation
- Applies fixes for common, well-understood issues
- Supports dependency vulnerabilities, linting errors, caching issues
- Performs clean installations and cache clearing
- Validates fixes before committing

### Issue Management
- Creates GitHub issues for tracked failures
- Groups failures by type to avoid issue spam
- Updates existing issues with new occurrences
- Auto-closes issues when problems are resolved

### Retry Logic
- Automatically retries workflows after successful fixes
- Implements backoff strategies for different failure types
- Tracks retry attempts and success rates

## Supported Failure Types

### Auto-Fixable

1. **Dependency Vulnerabilities**
   - Runs `pnpm audit fix`
   - Updates package lockfiles
   - Commits security patches

2. **Linting Errors**
   - Runs `pnpm run lint:fix`
   - Applies ESLint auto-fixes
   - Formats code with Prettier

3. **Dependency Errors**
   - Clears package manager cache
   - Performs clean dependency installation
   - Resolves lockfile conflicts

4. **Deployment Errors**
   - Verifies environment variables
   - Retries deployments with clean state
   - Checks service status

### Manual Review Required

1. **TypeScript Errors**
   - Creates detailed analysis
   - Suggests review areas
   - Cannot auto-fix type issues

2. **Test Failures**
   - Identifies failing tests
   - Detects flaky test patterns
   - Recommends review strategies

3. **Build Errors**
   - Analyzes compilation errors
   - Identifies webpack/bundling issues
   - Suggests configuration reviews

## Configuration

The system is configured via `.github/failure-remediation-config.yml`:

```yaml
patterns:
  dependency_vulnerability:
    keywords: ["npm audit", "pnpm audit", "vulnerability"]
    severity: high
    auto_fixable: true
    remediation:
      - step: "dependency_audit_fix"
        command: "pnpm audit fix --audit-level moderate"
```

### Configuration Options

- **patterns**: Define failure detection patterns and remediation steps
- **retry_strategies**: Configure retry logic for different scenarios
- **issue_management**: Control GitHub issue creation and management
- **notifications**: Set up Slack/Discord/Teams webhooks
- **advanced**: Enable ML analysis and performance regression detection

## Usage

### Manual Commands

```bash
# Analyze a failure log
npm run remediate:analyze failure.log

# Apply remediation (dry run)
npm run remediate:dry analysis.json

# Apply actual fixes
npm run remediate:fix analysis.json

# View failure history
npm run remediate:report
```

### GitHub Actions Integration

The system runs automatically, but you can also trigger it manually:

1. Go to Actions â†’ Auto-Remediate Failures
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Monitor the results in the workflow summary

## Workflow Process

1. **Detection**: Monitor for workflow failures
2. **Analysis**: Download logs and analyze failure patterns
3. **Classification**: Determine failure type and confidence
4. **Issue Creation**: Create/update GitHub issues with details
5. **Remediation**: Apply automatic fixes where possible
6. **Validation**: Test fixes with basic commands
7. **Commit**: Push fixes to repository
8. **Retry**: Trigger workflow retry
9. **Cleanup**: Close resolved issues when workflows succeed

## Monitoring and Alerts

### GitHub Issues
- Auto-created issues track failure patterns
- Labeled for easy filtering and prioritization
- Include detailed analysis and recommended actions
- Auto-closed when issues are resolved

### Workflow Summaries
- Detailed reports in GitHub Actions
- Success/failure metrics for remediation attempts
- Historical context and trends
- Recommended next steps

### Failure History
- JSON file tracking all failure patterns
- Success rates for different remediation types
- Most affected workflows and jobs
- Trend analysis over time

## Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Review auto-created issues** regularly
2. **Don't ignore manual fix requirements** - some issues need human attention
3. **Update configuration** when you discover new failure patterns
4. **Monitor success rates** and improve remediation steps

### For DevOps Teams
1. **Configure webhooks** for real-time notifications
2. **Set up proper secrets** for auto-remediation
3. **Review failure patterns** weekly
4. **Update retry strategies** based on historical data

### For Project Managers
1. **Track failure trends** using the reporting features
2. **Allocate time** for manual fixes when auto-remediation isn't possible
3. **Review success metrics** to improve CI/CD reliability

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Remediation not triggering**
   - Check workflow permissions
   - Verify GitHub token has write access
   - Review pattern matching in logs

2. **Fixes not being committed**
   - Check git configuration in workflow
   - Verify branch protection rules
   - Review file permissions

3. **High false positive rate**
   - Tune pattern keywords in config
   - Adjust confidence thresholds
   - Review historical data

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test pattern matching
node scripts/failure-remediation.js analyze failure.log

# Dry run remediation
node scripts/failure-remediation.js remediate analysis.json --dry-run

# View detailed logs
cat .github/failure-history.json | jq '.'
```

## Security Considerations

- All fixes are committed with clear attribution
- Dependency updates are limited to security patches
- No sensitive data is exposed in logs or issues
- Rate limiting prevents excessive API calls
- All changes go through normal PR review if branch protection is enabled

## Performance Impact

- Minimal overhead on normal workflow runs
- Only activates on failures or scheduled checks
- Caches analysis results to avoid repeated work
- Implements exponential backoff for retries
- Cleans up old data automatically

## Future Enhancements

- AI-powered failure analysis using GPT/Claude
- Integration with monitoring tools (DataDog, New Relic)
- Slack/Teams bot for interactive remediation
- Predictive failure detection
- Performance regression analysis
- Custom remediation plugins

## Contributing

To add new failure patterns:

1. Update `.github/failure-remediation-config.yml`
2. Add remediation logic in `scripts/failure-remediation.js`
3. Test with sample failure logs
4. Document the new pattern type
5. Submit PR with test cases

## Support

For issues with the remediation system:

1. Check the failure history logs
2. Review GitHub Actions workflow logs
3. Create an issue with the `automation` label
4. Include sample failure logs if possible
