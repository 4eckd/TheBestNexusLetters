## üöÄ Deployment Procedures

### Production Deployment

#### Pre-deployment Checklist

- [ ] All tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Security scan completed successfully
- [ ] Database migrations reviewed and approved
- [ ] Feature flags configured (if applicable)
- [ ] Rollback plan prepared
- [ ] Stakeholders notified

#### Deployment Steps

1. **Trigger Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Create and push release tag
   git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Release version 1.2.3"
   git push origin v1.2.3
   ```

2. **Monitor Deployment**
   - Watch GitHub Actions workflow
   - Verify Vercel deployment status
   - Check application health endpoints

3. **Post-deployment Verification**
   ```bash
   # Health check
   curl https://thebestnexusletters.com/api/health
   
   # Authentication test
   curl https://thebestnexusletters.com/api/auth/session
   
   # Database connectivity
   curl https://thebestnexusletters.com/api/status
   ```

4. **Rollback Procedure** (if needed)
   ```bash
   # Revert to previous version in Vercel dashboard
   # Or redeploy previous Git commit
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin main
   ```

### Staging Deployment

Every push to `main` branch automatically deploys to staging:

- **URL**: https://staging.thebestnexusletters.com
- **Purpose**: Final testing before production
- **Auto-deploy**: Yes (on main branch push)

### Database Migrations

#### Production Migration Process

```bash
# 1. Create migration (in development)
pnpm run supabase:migration new migration_name

# 2. Test migration locally
pnpm run supabase:reset
pnpm run supabase:migrate

# 3. Apply to staging
# (Automatic via CI/CD)

# 4. Apply to production
# (Automatic via CD pipeline when tagged)
```

#### Emergency Migration Rollback

```sql
-- Connect to production database
-- Restore from backup or manual rollback
-- Document in incident report
```
