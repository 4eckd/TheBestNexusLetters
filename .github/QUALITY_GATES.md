# 🛡️ Quality Gates System

This document describes the automated quality gates implemented to maintain high code quality and security standards across The Best Nexus Letters project.

## 📋 Overview

The quality gates system consists of multiple automated components working together:

1. **Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline** - Comprehensive testing and validation
2. **Pull Request Template** - Enforces comprehensive checklists
3. **Automated Labeling** - Intelligent PR categorization
4. **Semantic Release** - Automated versioning and changelog generation
5. **Advanced Dependabot** - Automated, secure dependency updates

## 🧪 Quality Gates Components

### 1. Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci-enhanced.yml`)

#### Quality Gates Job
Runs on every pull request with comprehensive validation:

**Security & Vulnerability Checks**
- `pnpm audit --audit-level moderate` - Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Hardcoded secrets detection using regex patterns
- Security-sensitive file monitoring

**Code Quality Checks**
- ESLint with caching - Code style and quality validation
- Prettier format checking - Consistent code formatting
- TypeScript strict mode compilation - Type safety verification

**Testing with Coverage Enforcement**
- **Coverage Threshold**: 85% minimum required
- Unit tests with `pnpm test:coverage`
- Integration tests with `pnpm test:integration`
- Coverage validation using `coverage-summary.json`

**Performance Monitoring**
- Bundle size impact analysis
- Build performance tracking
- Performance regression detection

#### E2E Testing Job
- Full end-to-end testing with Playwright
- Supabase local environment setup
- Multi-browser compatibility testing
- Accessibility testing integration

#### Preview Deployment Job
- Automatic Vercel preview deployments
- Environment-specific configuration
- PR comment with preview links
- Quality gate status reporting

#### Semantic Versioning Job
- Automated version bumping based on conventional commits
- CHANGELOG.md generation
- GitHub release creation
- Package.json version updates

### 2. Pull Request Template (`.github/pull_request_template.md`)

### 3. Automated Labeling System (`.github/labeler.yml`)

**Area-based Labels**
- `area:components`, `area:pages`, `area:api`
- `area:database`, `area:auth`, `area:ui`
- `area:hooks`, `area:utils`, `area:types`

**Size-based Labels**
- `size:xs` (1-3 files), `size:small` (4-10 files)
- `size:medium` (11-30 files), `size:large` (31-100 files)
- `size:xl` (101-300 files), `size:xxl` (>300 files)

**Type-based Labels**
- `type:feature`, `type:bugfix`, `type:hotfix`
- `type:refactor`, `type:chore`, `type:docs`
- `type:test`, `type:ci`, `type:style`, `type:perf`

**Priority Labels**
- `priority:critical` (hotfix/emergency)
- `priority:high` (security/important)
- `priority:low` (minor/optional)

**Framework-specific Labels**
- `framework:nextjs`, `framework:react`
- `database:supabase`, `styling:tailwind`
- `tool:storybook`, `tool:playwright`, `tool:vitest`

### 4. Semantic Release Configuration (`.releaserc.json`)

**Release Rules**
- `feat:` → minor version bump
- `fix:` → patch version bump
- `BREAKING CHANGE:` → major version bump
- Other types → patch version bump

**Automated Changelog**
- Categorized by change type with emojis
- 🚀 Features, 🐛 Bug Fixes, 📚 Documentation
- ♻️ Code Refactoring, ⚡ Performance Improvements
- ✅ Tests, 👷 Build System, 🔧 CI

**GitHub Integration**
- Automated GitHub releases
- Success/failure comments on PRs
- Release assets (CHANGELOG.md)

### 5. Advanced Dependabot Configuration (`.github/dependabot.yml`)

pnpm test:coverage -- --reporter=html

# View coverage report
open coverage/index.html
```

#### ESLint Errors
```bash
# Fix auto-fixable issues
pnpm lint:fix

# Check specific file
pnpm lint src/path/to/file.ts
```

#### TypeScript Errors
```bash
# Type check only
pnpm type-check

# Check specific file
npx tsc --noEmit src/path/to/file.ts
```

#### Preview Deployment Failures
- Check Vercel secrets configuration
